# simple-task-tracker
A simple task-tracking app built to explore GitHub Projects and Issues. The focus was on project management workflows, such as milestones and task boards. The app was intentionally minimal and created to test how these tools integrated with conventional dev workflows.

For more details about the tools, see the [GitHub Projects Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) and [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues).
